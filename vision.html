    <h1>Our Vision</h1>
    <p class="vision-intro">More than a house — a living, breathing home shaped by who we are and what we value.</p>
    <hr class="section-divider">
    <p>We envision a warm, welcoming home that feels timeless yet forward-thinking, blending natural materials, energy efficiency, and thoughtful design into a sanctuary that will support our lives for decades to come.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to create a space that is beautiful, functional, and sustainable, balancing aesthetic aspirations with environmental responsibility. We want a home that feels deeply rooted in its surroundings, where architecture, landscape, and lifestyle flow together naturally.</p>
      <div class="list-wrapper">
  <ul>
    <li>A strong connection between indoor and outdoor living spaces</li>
    <li>Low environmental impact and high energy efficiency</li>
    <li>Spaces designed for family life, creativity, and quiet reflection</li>
    <li>Craftsmanship, quality materials, and lasting beauty</li>
    <li>A nurturing and inspiring place to grow, love, and thrive</li>

    <h2>Sustainability Goals</h2>
    <p class="vision-intro">Living lightly on the earth, building with responsibility and heart.</p>
    <hr class="section-divider">
 <p>Our commitment to sustainability runs deeper than just meeting standards, it’s a core value shaping every decision we make. We want our home to work with the environment, not against it: reducing energy demand, using sustainable and low-impact materials, and creating a comfortable, low-carbon living environment.</p>
  <p>Wherever possible, we are sourcing responsibly, prioritising durability over disposability, and designing for long-term efficiency. From insulation choices to energy systems, our approach is about mindful stewardship, for our family and for the future.</p>

    <h2>Build Approach</h2>
    <p class="vision-intro">Collaboration, craftsmanship, and a commitment to doing things the right way.</p>
    <hr class="section-divider">
  <p>This project is a true collaboration between ourselves, architects, tradespeople, consultants, and local authorities. Our approach is hands-on, open-minded, and solutions-focused. We are committed to clear communication, shared vision, and respect for the process as it unfolds.</p>
  <p>Self-building a home is a challenge we welcome, not because it's easy, but because it’s meaningful. Every stage of this project, from the earliest sketches to the final finishes, is an opportunity to create something honest, enduring, and full of heart.</p>

    <h2>Local Environment</h2>
    <p class="vision-intro">Working with nature, respecting heritage, and nurturing the environment we call home.</p>
    <hr class="section-divider">
 <p>The Reigate Road site sits in a cherished part of the Surrey landscape, close to woodland, nature reserves, and historic towns, yet with excellent connections to London and the South East.</p>
      <p>We are deeply committed to respecting and enhancing the local environment through our project. Our design approach will consider the character of the area, local building traditions, and ecological best practices to ensure that our new home complements its setting.</p>
      <p>We are engaging with local consultants, planners, and artisans to ensure that sustainability, biodiversity, and community values are woven into every stage of our build.</p>

  <p>We see our home as part of a larger story, one that includes our neighbours, the local ecology, and the history of the area. Respecting the character of the community, contributing positively to the neighbourhood, and enhancing the land are important responsibilities we take seriously.</p>
  <p>We are committed to thoughtful landscaping, maintaining biodiversity, and creating a home that feels like a natural continuation of its setting, rather than an imposition on it.</p>
